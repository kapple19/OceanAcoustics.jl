# OceanAcoustics
An implementation of acoustics models in the context of long-range ocean propagation.

## Development Roadmap
* Models:
  * Ray/beam tracing
  * Parabolic equation
  * Sonar equations
* Auxiliary:
  * Example scenarios
  * Plot recipes

### Tasks
* Look into getting extrema for a given mathematically defined function in Julia.
* Implement `Base.show` for my types.
  * Look into `StructArray`.
  * Or, look into what my structs should be subtypes of.
